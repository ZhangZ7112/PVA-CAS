The source code of "Partial Vessels Annotation-based Coronary Artery Segmentation with Self-training and Prototype Learning".
[Note] **The code will be gradually and continuously released!**
Coronary artery segmentation on coronary-computed tomography angiography (CCTA) images is crucial for clinical use. Due to the expertise-required and labor-intensive annotation process, there is a growing demand for the relevant label-efficient learning algorithms. To this end, we propose partial vessels annotation (PVA) based on the challenges of coronary artery segmentation and clinical diagnostic characteristics. Further, we propose a progressive weakly supervised learning framework to achieve accurate segmentation under PVA.
